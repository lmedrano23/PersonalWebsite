 <h1 class="backcolor">BACKGROUND</h1><!--I should Include that below are synopses of each projects respectfully. -->
 <p class="paraClassTwo">Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Luis Medrano. I graduated at the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor's of Science degree
  in Computer Engineering with a Computer Science Minor. My passion within Embedded Systems, Software Engineering & Robotics but I'm always 
  interested and invested to branch out; learning different diciplines and applying my hardware and software development skills to any position.
</p>
<h1 class="backcolor">HARDWARE PROJECTS</h1>
<h2>TRON Game VHDL Hardware Design Programming Development: </h2><!--Should include a padding feature in a CSS div class instead of using <br> in front of paragraph-->
<p class="paraClassOne"> Applying my knowledge of VHDL Programming Language upon the DE01 FPGA, I was able to reinvent Tron's Light-Cycle video game.
 Within the first few weeks, I worked with a partner to construct most of the mechanics of the game along with its visual sprites of our liking. By repurposing some
     mechanics from a Racquetball Game that worked/developed with upon previous lab assignments; we would apply the mobility for both the playable character and the
    AI/opponent. In other words, the mobility of the "ball" in the Racquetball Game (as previously mentioned) would get tweaked and redefined to move: Forward, Backward,
      Left, and Right. Instead of diagonal movements like in the original ball game. After this implementation, we desided to work on the Sprites' portion of the video game
      in which we decided on using <em>Nintendo's Super Mario Bros</em> characters: Luigi and Boo/Teresa.</p>
<h2>Computer Architecture: Single-Cycle Datapath Proccessor: </h2>
<p class="paraClassOne">The Single-Cycle Datapath Processor project was the ultimate task to complete for the Computer Architecture course. This involved working with a team of four
    people to work collaboratively on figuring out the best methods of modifying or upgrading parts of a processor to fully developing components for the final touch
    that would result in a single-cycle datapath, A.K.A. a computer processor. Through working with a team, we needed to assemble our own processor and components with
    our own methods and creativity in the end. The project involved developing: ALU, Memory-block(RAM and ROM), Schematic designing, Low-Level Hardware Programming, and
    Assembly Language Application.</p>
<h2>Computer Design and Optimization for Secure Hash Algorithm: </h2>
<p class="paraClassOne">The SHA-512 Project is essentially the continuation from what one would learn after developing a processor (which you may refer to the project
    "Computer Architecture Single-Cycle Datapath Processor"). This project involved a predeveloped CPU labeled as the "Rhody CPU"; developed through the hardware development
     program: VHDL . The Assembly language in question was also developed in respect to the computer processor of this project in which resembled to the MIPS Assembly Language
     model. The Secure Hash Algorithim 512 (the SHA-512) is an algorithm that handles the performance, that is, to improve the throughput capabilities of a processor. The 
     algorithim itself is meant to process any input value of any size and as a result; returns hashes or 64 bytes of data.</p>
<h1 class="backcolor">EMBEDDED SOFTWARE/SYSTEMS PROJECTS</h1>
<h2>Autonomous Bot:</h2>
<p class="paraClassOne"> The Autonomous Bot Project was my first project that involved Embedded Software Programming, Robotics, and C/C++ appliance. True to its name, The
    Autonomous Bot is a robot that utilizes motor and a sensor to traverse a convoluted area (ideally a maze). The motors involved are two DC motors (3-6V dependency) which
    are conducted with a motor driver; L298N model. The third motor applied to the system is the Servo motor; a motor that requires 3.3V - 5V and can be controlled by the
    microcontroller directly(no driver necessary). This motor uses three pins: VCC, GND, & TRG. The Servo can be directed/programmed with angular values. </p>
<h2>Radio Transceiver Research & Testing:</h2>
<p class="paraClassOne">
    When I first learned about the aspects of SPI (wireless) communications between embedded platforms, it started through my self-teaching route in the NRF24L01 radio module.
    The introduction to this device was during the time I was part of the IEEE extracurricular program. The committee behooved each group to obtain a kit that involed the
    microcontroller: Arduino UNO, along with other equipments including a pair of the NRF24L01 tranceivers. Throughout my learning progress I had to research and investigate
    proper documentations regarding the very radio trasceiver model in order to appropriately configure each I/O pins and appending certain programming modules that would
    enable each microcontroller to conduct each radio module as the transmitter and/or receiver, respectively. I would set up an Arduino UNO (as the transmitter) and an 
    Arduino MEGA (as the receiver) with a code that would enable the sender to transmit a string of words to the recipient. The word used: "Hello World!" (for the culture, 
    of course).</p>
    <p class="paraClassOne">This stage of my personal research required trial and error to effectively have both devices communicating. Complications of the matter involved mistakes like:
    not knowing the proper pin configuration for it's respective microcontroller model; that is the pin setting in the Arduino Uno would not be the same as the Arduino Mega. 
    Faulty programming was another issue that required intricate troubleshooting when it came down to sending the data to proper binary address and obtaining the very data
    through the memory address the variable that would be given the task to receive it in the program. Though some work were more tedious and arduous than others, I was finally
    able to have a successful communication system between both embedded systems. As a final touch I decided to send numerical values, specifically float values (numbers with 2
    decimals) from one point to another. And the way I decided to send constant float values was through an ultrasonic sensor; attached to the transmitter. While the transmitter 
    would send these values through the sensor, the receiver would have a Servo motor attached to it; moving in the direction represented by the values that the sender would give.
    This experiment would inspire a more complicated and more purposeful project the following year in 2024: the <i>Radio Transciever Remote control car</i>.
